**How the scrobbler works?**

At this moment you must have your content identified by any available scrapper (TMDb, IMDb, TVdb, ...). At the end of any TV episode or movie you will be prompted to rate your experience. There is an option that if you create a playlist, the rating window will not disturb you while you are watching.

_**If the content will be not recognized correctly, we have created a simple option for you to correct it manually. After this correction, it will never happen again to your or to any other user.**_

We have identified the title mismatching as the biggest issue for users and we are working very hard to give you more precise identification with no extra requirements.

**How to install it?**

   * In your **XBMC** go to **Settings -> Add-ons -> Search** and search for **synopsi**
   * Select the **SynopsiTV** plugin and click install
   * After installation go to **SynopsiTV** plugin settings
   * **Log in** or create an account
   * Your data will **start synchronizing immediately** and you will see what you watch on your www.synopsi.tv profile
